# Event Logging Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully replaced mock system events with real user activity logging throughout the RAG server application. The system now tracks actual user interactions instead of generating fake activity data.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Authentication Routes (`src/api/routes/auth.py`)
- **Login logging**: Added real-time logging of user login events with IP address and user agent tracking
- **Logout logging**: Added proper session termination logging
- **User session tracking**: Integrated with metrics collectors to track user sessions

### 2. Document Routes (`src/api/routes/documents.py`)
- **Upload logging**: Real-time logging of document uploads with file metadata (size, type, processing time)
- **Batch upload logging**: Individual logging for each document in batch operations
- **Delete logging**: Proper logging of document deletion events
- **Processing time tracking**: Actual timing of upload and processing operations

### 3. Metrics Middleware (`src/metrics/collectors.py`)
- **JWT token extraction**: Proper user ID extraction from real JWT tokens
- **API request logging**: Enhanced logging for query endpoints
- **User activity tracking**: Real-time user activity updates
- **IP address and user agent capture**: Complete request context logging

### 4. Database Integration
- **System events table**: All events now stored in SQLite database with proper relationships
- **User session tracking**: Complete session lifecycle management
- **Document event tracking**: Full document operation history
- **Query logging**: API query performance and success tracking

## Event Types Now Tracked

### Authentication Events
```
- "user_login": User successfully authenticated
- "user_logout": User ended session
```

### Document Events
```
- "document_uploaded": File uploaded to system
- "document_deleted": File removed from system
```

### Query Events
```  
- "query_performed": RAG query executed (via middleware)
```

## Database Schema

### system_events table
```sql
CREATE TABLE system_events (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    event_type TEXT NOT NULL,           -- Type of event (user_login, document_uploaded, etc.)
    user_id TEXT,                       -- Actual user ID from JWT token
    admin_user_id TEXT,                 -- Admin user if applicable  
    description TEXT NOT NULL,          -- Human-readable description
    details TEXT,                       -- JSON metadata about the event
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Testing and Verification

### 1. Manual Testing
Run the test script to verify event logging:
```bash
python test_event_logging.py
```

### 2. Clear Mock Data
Remove any existing mock events:
```bash
python clear_mock_events.py
```

### 3. API Verification
Check recent activity via API:
```bash
# Login and get token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}' \
    http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login | jq -r .access_token)

# Check recent activity  
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    http://localhost:8000/api/v1/monitoring/metrics/recent-activity | jq '.[0:5]'
```

### 4. Dashboard Verification
- Navigate to `http://localhost:8501` (Streamlit dashboard)
- Check the "Recent Activity" section in the dashboard
- Perform login/logout and document operations
- Verify real activities appear instead of mock data

## Real Data Examples

### Before (Mock Data):
```json
{
  "time": "2 hours ago",
  "user": "jane.smith", 
  "action": "Daily backup completed",
  "details": ""
}
```

### After (Real Data):
```json
{
  "time": "Just now",
  "user": "1",
  "action": "User logged in", 
  "details": "{\"ip_address\": \"127.0.0.1\", \"user_agent\": \"Python/3.12 aiohttp/3.10.5\"}"
}
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Real User Tracking**: Actual user IDs from authentication system
2. **Complete Audit Trail**: Full history of all user actions
3. **Rich Metadata**: IP addresses, user agents, processing times, file details
4. **Database Persistence**: All events stored in SQLite for historical analysis
5. **Dashboard Integration**: Real-time activity feed in web interface
6. **API Monitoring**: Automatic logging of API endpoint usage

## Files Modified

1. `src/api/routes/auth.py` - Authentication event logging
2. `src/api/routes/documents.py` - Document operation logging  
3. `src/metrics/collectors.py` - Middleware and collector improvements
4. `test_event_logging.py` - Test script for verification
5. `clear_mock_events.py` - Utility to clear mock data

## Error Handling

All event logging includes proper error handling to ensure that:
- Application functionality never fails due to logging errors
- Logging failures are captured in application logs
- Users receive proper responses even if event logging fails

## Future Enhancements

1. **Query Content Logging**: Extract actual query text from request bodies
2. **Advanced Metrics**: Token usage, processing costs, success rates
3. **User Behavior Analytics**: Session duration, usage patterns
4. **Alert System**: Notifications for suspicious activities
5. **Data Export**: Historical event data export capabilities

The system now provides complete visibility into actual user activities instead of mock data, enabling proper monitoring, analytics, and audit capabilities.
